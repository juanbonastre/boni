# Boni design and interaction guide

**Boni Calendar (desktop) is the reference.** Every Boni app (Boni desktop and its widgets, the Android clients, the
Boni Calendar mobile app, the Obsidian plugin) must look and behave like it. When something is not specified here, copy
what Boni Calendar does. Changes to the look or the behaviour start in Boni Calendar, are recorded here in the same pull
request, and then propagate to the other apps. A deviation needs a written reason in the deviating app's docs.

Authoritative sources: this file, the tokens in `apps/web/src/styles.css` (`:root` and `:root[data-theme="light"]`), and the
behaviour covered by `e2e/`. Validated by Juan on the desktop app up to version 0.3.2; the mobile section is a proposal for later.

## 1. Principles
- Calm and dense: graphite surfaces, one accent colour, thin lines, no decoration. Colour means *which calendar*.
- Direct manipulation: drag to create, move and resize, with a live preview while dragging. `Esc` cancels any gesture.
- No confirmation dialogs. Destructive actions happen at once and offer **Undo** in a toast (and `Ctrl+Z`). The only
  question we ask is the "this / this and following / all" scope for a recurring event.
- Keyboard first, but never keyboard only: everything also has a visible control or a context menu. Nothing is
  hover-only.
- Smooth: 60 fps while scrolling, zooming and dragging is a requirement, not a nice-to-have (`docs/rendimiento.md`).
- Text never stretches or jumps when the layout moves (zoom keeps letter sizes), and it is always pixel-sharp: boxes, offsets
  and column or row sizes are whole device pixels (see `AGENTS.md`, "Sharp text").

## 2. Visual tokens
| Token | Dark (default) | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#16171a` | `#ffffff` |
| `--surface` | `#1d1e22` | `#ffffff` |
| `--surface-2` | `#232429` | `#f5f5f7` |
| `--sidebar` | `#121316` | `#f3f3f6` |
| `--line` / `--line-soft` / `--line-strong` | `#25262b` / `#1f2024` / `#34363d` | `#e6e6ea` / `#efeff2` / `#d4d4db` |
| `--text` / `--muted` | `#e9eaed` / `#8b8f99` | `#1b1c20` / `#666a75` |
| `--accent` / `--accent-soft` | `#7b8cff` / 16 % accent | `#4b5ce0` / 12 % accent |
| `--now` (current time, today) | `#ff5f5f` | `#e5383b` |
| `--hover` | white 6 % | black 5 % |
| Shadow (menus, popovers) | `0 12px 40px #0008, 0 2px 8px #0006` | softer, bluish |

Calendar palette (colour of a calendar, always from this list): violet `#a78bfa`, orange `#fb923c`, coral `#f87171`,
amber `#fbbf24`, green `#4ade80`, teal `#2dd4bf`, sky `#38bdf8`, blue `#60a5fa`, pink `#f472b6`, red `#ef4444`,
slate `#94a3b8`.

- **Type:** Inter, then the system stack. Base 13 px / 1.4. Month title 22 px, weight 650, year in `--muted`. Small text
  11 to 12.5 px. Times and numbers use tabular figures.
- **Radii:** 6 (small controls, event cards), 7 to 8 (buttons, pills, inputs), 10 (menus, cards), 12 (popover), 14 (modals).
- **Sizes:** controls 28 to 30 px high, icon buttons 28 px square, menu rows 30 px. Sidebar 252 px, top bar 62 px, event
  popover 340 px, side panel 352 px, hour gutter 64 px.
- **Icons:** Lucide, 14 to 16 px, stroke 1.8, `--muted` until hovered. No product or brand icons.
- **Event card:** background = calendar colour mixed into `--bg` at 24 % (dark) or 20 % (light); text = calendar colour
  mixed into `--text` (30 % dark, 55 % light); 3 px solid left border in the calendar colour; hover +8 % tint; selected =
  2 px `--accent` ring; done tasks 60 % opacity with strike-through; recurring events carry a small repeat icon.
- **Today:** day number in an `--accent` circle, column tinted 4 %; the current time is a `--now` line with a dot and a
  label in the hour gutter.
- **Hidden calendars:** hollow swatch, muted name, struck eye icon.

## 3. Patterns
- Top bar: title (month in bold, year muted), view picker, "Today", previous/next, detail-panel toggle.
- Sidebar: mini month whose highlighted band is exactly the visible days, calendars grouped by account with colour
  swatch, eye (and a properties gear on hover), search and new-event buttons on top, settings at the bottom.
- Event detail header: (open note in Obsidian, only for events that have a note), more, expand, close. The detail is a popover anchored to the event; the expand button turns it into a right side panel. Fields in order:
  title, date and times, repeat, calendar, type (Event / Task) and done (only when the calendar maps a task column),
  calendar properties, location, description, read-only id and timestamps.
- Context menus (right click or long press) on events, empty time slots, month cells and calendars; the same actions as
  the detail where they exist. Several selected events: actions apply to all and show "(n)".
- Calendar properties dialog (sidebar gear, context menu): name, colour, **Calendar view** (which column of each row plays
  date, start and end time, end date and tasks; a status column also asks "Done when"), then **Other properties** (the
  columns the view does not use, each with its type and options). Mapped columns never appear twice: they are controls of
  the event (date, times, task), not properties. A calendar is a view of a collection of rows; rows are the truth.
- Command palette (`Ctrl+K`): commands, event search, "go to date" and natural-language quick create
  ("clase FUP manana 10-12 #docencia").
- Toasts at the bottom centre with an Undo action. A floating selection bar appears with two or more selected events.
- Option labels never wrap; menus align to stay inside their popover.

## 4. Interaction rules
- **Wheel:** vertical scroll; `Ctrl` + wheel zooms the hours around the pointer; `Shift` + wheel moves across days and
  settles on a whole day. Motion is exponentially smoothed (about 70 to 85 ms time constants) and never snaps.
- **Views:** day, week, N days (2 to 14), month. First weekday and 12/24 h are settings (default Monday, 24 h).
- **Shortcuts:** `T` today, `D` `W` `M` views, `1` to `9` N days, arrows or `J`/`K` previous and next, `N` or `/` palette,
  `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` undo and redo, `Delete` delete selection, `Ctrl+A` select visible, `[` sidebar, `Ctrl+,`
  settings, `?` help, `Esc` closes or cancels.
- **Dragging:** drag on empty space to create (default 15-minute snap, setting), drag a card to move, drag its top or
  bottom edge to resize. Edges follow the pointer in both axes, so dragging into the next or previous day's column
  makes an event cross midnight. All-day events move and resize by whole days, in the all-day row and in the month.
  Dragging near the top or bottom edge auto-scrolls.
- **Selection:** click selects one and opens its detail; `Ctrl`+click adds or removes; `Shift`+click adds the range
  from the anchor in chronological order; `Ctrl+Shift`+click adds that range but only for the clicked event's calendar.
  Dragging one selected event moves all of them. Click on empty space or `Esc` clears. While `Ctrl`/`Shift` is held the
  popover lets clicks through.
- **Series in the vault:** repeating an event creates one note per occurrence (up to 12 months ahead; open-ended series are
  topped up whenever the vault is read with writing on, with a toast saying how many were created). The same "this / this and
  following / all" question applies; "all" on a deletion keeps the past notes (the dialog says so); marking a task done only
  changes that note; changing the repetition rule replaces the later notes with the ones the new rule makes.
- **Recurrence:** editing, moving or deleting an occurrence asks "Only this event / This and following events / All
  events" (cancel is always possible). Changing the repetition rule itself applies to the whole series.
- **Tasks:** an event can be switched to Task in the detail or the context menu; tasks show a checkbox in the card. A
  calendar offers this only if its view maps a task column: a checkbox column (empty = event, unchecked = open task,
  checked = done) or a status column with chosen done states. Calendars without one show no Event / Task controls.
- **Read-only calendars** can be selected but not edited or dragged.
- **Data in the vault** (desktop app, Settings → Data): writing is opt-in ("Read only" / "Read and write"). With it on, the
  gestures above change the notes: only the edited properties are rewritten (unknown ones, comments and the body stay as
  they were), a new event becomes a note when it has a title (file `{date} {title}.md`, with a counter on the file name if
  taken), moving it to another calendar moves its file, deleting sends it to the trash and Undo brings it back. If a note
  changed outside the app since it was read, nothing is written: a toast says so and the notes are reloaded. Notes the
  calendar cannot place are listed in Settings, never hidden.
- Every edit is optimistic and undoable; one gesture is one undo step.

## 5. Language and copy
Spanish first, English second, all through `src/i18n.ts` (no hard-coded text). The UI uses proper Spanish with accents
(the "no accents" rule belongs to generated vault notes and chat, not to the product). Labels are short and imperative;
dates use the locale (`Mie 17 sep '25`); durations as `1h 15min`.

## 6. Adapting it to other platforms
- **Boni desktop / Android clients (Compose):** same hex tokens, radii, type scale and event-card recipe. Until there is a
  second web consumer, copy the values from section 2; when it exists, move them to a shared tokens file (JSON) that both
  the CSS and the Compose theme are generated from.
- **Obsidian plugin:** uses these tokens, scoped to the plugin's own container, so it looks like Boni Calendar inside Obsidian
  (decided by Juan, 2026-10-15; it does not follow Obsidian's theme variables).
- **Mobile (proposal, accepted in principle by Juan but deferred until the desktop apps are finished):** same tokens and card recipe. The popover becomes a bottom sheet that
  expands to a full-screen detail; the sidebar becomes a drawer; "new event" is a floating button. Long press = context
  menu; drag to create, move and resize works like desktop with touch targets of at least 44 dp; pinch zooms the hours;
  vertical swipe scrolls and horizontal swipe moves days; no keyboard shortcuts, so every one needs a visible control;
  Undo through a snackbar.

## 7. Keeping it consistent
- A pull request that changes look or behaviour in Boni Calendar updates this file.
- Another Boni app that needs a new component first looks here; if the component is missing, design it in Boni Calendar's
  language, add it here, then reuse it.
- Screenshots in `e2e/screenshots/` (generated by the e2e suite) are the visual reference.
